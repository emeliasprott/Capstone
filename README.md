# Decoding the California Legislative Process

This project collects, cleans, and analyzes data related to Californiaâ€™s legislative activities. The goal is to provide clear insights into the lawmaking process, including the development of bills, the final legislative outcomes, and the financial factors influencing decision-making.

## I. Introduction

## II. Data

### a. Legislative Information (*ca_leg*)

- Download ZIP files containing .dat and .lob files from official California state sources.
- Use a Docker container with a PostgreSQL database to extract data from the .dat and .lob files.
- Ensure .lob files are Unicode encoded and parse them as XML files into JSON format.
- Store the extracted data in CSV files

### b. Final Histories (*pdf_parsing*)

### c. Lobbying and Campaign Finance (*calaccess*)

The California Automated Lobbyist and Campaign Contribution and Expenditure Search System (CAL-ACCESS) is a database maintained by the California Secretary of State. It tracks campaign finance and lobbying activities, providing financial information supplied by state candidates, donors, lobbyists, and others.
